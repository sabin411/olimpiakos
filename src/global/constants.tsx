He was also part of Bangladesh's set-up in the just-concluded Asia Cup.",

Right-arm pacer Sam Cook was quite impressive with the new ball as he dismissed opener Finlay Bean for a duck. Cook picked three wickets and was the pick of the bowlers for Essex as most of them were top-order scalps. Barring George Hill and Jonathan Tattersall, none of the batters were able to chip in with handy contributions as Yorkshire kept losing wickets at regular intervals throughout the innings.',
